This project is a DDD sample for a coffee shop.

The scenario is below
```
CoffeeCo is a national coffee shop chain. They experienced rapid growth in the last year and have opened
50 new stores. Each store sells coffee and coffee-related accessories, as well as store-specific drinks. Stores
often have individual offers, but national marketing campaigns are often run, which influence the price
of an item too.

CoffeeCo recently launched a loyalty program called CoffeeBux, which allows customers to get 1 free
drink for every 10 they purchase. It doesn't matter which store they purchase a drink at or which they
redeem it at.
```

The application can run as following scripts
```
1. make docker-compose-up
2. go run cmd/main.go
```
