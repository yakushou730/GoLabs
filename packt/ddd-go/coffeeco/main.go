package coffeeco

// CoffeeCo is a national coffee shop chain. They experienced rapid growth in the last year and have opened
// 50 new stores. Each store sells coffee and coffee-related accessories, as well as store-specific drinks. Stores
// often have individual offers, but national marketing campaigns are often run, which influence the price
// of an item too.
//
// CoffeeCo recently launched a loyalty program called CoffeeBux, which allows customers to get 1 free
// drink for every 10 they purchase. It doesn't matter which store they purchase a drink at or which they
// redeem it at.
